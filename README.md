### Don't forget to star this repo ü§ó

### This repository aims to help code beginners with their first successful pull request and open-source contribution. :partying_face:

:star: Feel free to use this project to make your first contribution to an open-source project on GitHub. Practice making your first pull request to a public repository before doing the real thing!

:star: Make sure to grab some cool swags during Hacktoberfest by getting involved in the open-source community.

### This repository is open to all members of the GitHub community. Any member can contribute to this project! The only thing which you need to keep in mind is that it should be genuine PR :grin:

## What is Hacktoberfest? :thinking:
A month-long celebration from October 1st to October 31st presented by [Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and [DEV Community](https://dev.to/) collaborated with [GitHub](https://github.com/blog/2433-celebrate-open-source-this-october-with-hacktoberfest) to get people involved in [Open Source](https://github.com/open-source). Create your very first pull request to any public repository on GitHub and contribute to the open-source developer community.

## Rules :fire:
To qualify for the __official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt__, you must register [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and make four Pull Requests (PRs) between October 1-31, 2022 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. This year, the __first 40,000__ participants who complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt.
